    <p>vocabulary you'll learn here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>propositions and arguments</li>
        <li>premises and conclusions</li>
        <li>validity and soundness</li>
        <li>deductive and inductive</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Every time anyone wants to reasonably convince someone else, they give arguments. 
    Reasons for why other people should believe them. We find that in science, politics 
    and in our dayli life. But what is an argument? To get a first grasp, consider the 
    following two texts. One of them is an argument, the other is not. Can you spot the 
    difference?
</p>
<p>
    Example 1:
"Death Metal, along with Black and Thrash Metal, is a subgenre of extreme metal. 
Its sound is characterized by hard, often dissonant melodies played on low-tuned guitars 
and accompanied by fast drumming and guttural shouts."
</p>
<p>
    Example 2:
"Traffic jams are a common problem in many cities, and they are often caused by the 
high number of cars on the road. Therefore, one way to reduce traffic congestion is 
to encourage more people to use public transportation or carpool."
</p>
<p>
    Example 1 and 2 are sequences of propositions, in which certain claims are made. 
    But the difference is, that while Example 1 is informing the reader about something 
    (Death Metal), Example 2 tries to convince the reader in some way to believe a 
    statement to be true. The statement in question is "one way to reduce traffic congestion 
    is to encourage more people to use public transportation or carpool". How does the 
    convincing work? Exactly, by giving reasons that support this statement.
</p>
<p>
    Accordingly, an argument is a sequence of propositions, accompanied by the claim 
    that a part of these propositions (the premises) support another proposition in the 
    sequence (the conclusion) in the sense that it is rational to hold the conclusion as 
    true if the premises are true.
</p>
<p>
    Yeah, that's a mouthful, I know. So let's look closer at Example 2, shall we?<br>
    "<span class="text-green">Traffic jams are a common problem in many cities</span>, 
    and <span class="text-green">they are often caused by the high number of cars on 
    the road</span>. Therefore, <span class="text-orange">one way to reduce traffic 
    congestion is to encourage more people to use public transportation or carpool</span>."
